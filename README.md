# Exploring-Mushrooms-Python

Mushrooms are a fascinating group of fungi that come in a wide range of colors, shapes, sizes, and textures. They can be found in almost every ecosystem on Earth, from forests and grasslands to deserts and oceans.

In this project, we'll be working with a dataset of mushroom characteristics, collected by the Mushroom Observation Society. The dataset includes 23 different characteristics of different mushroom species, such as their cap shape, cap color, and whether they are edible or poisonous.

Using this dataset, we can explore the diversity of mushrooms and learn more about their unique characteristics. We can use bar charts to visualize the distribution of different characteristics in the dataset, and see which characteristics are most common among mushroom species.

By analyzing this dataset, we can gain a better understanding of the world of mushrooms and the many different types that exist.
